    "#### What is optimisation?\n",
    "- Field of study that is concerned with finding the best decision (or decisions) from a set of available alternatives. In the simplest case, this is the problem of finding a maximum (or minimum) of a real function $f(x)$ of a real variable $x$.\n",
    "- As a subfield of theoritical computer science/computational mathematics, matured between 1980s - 2000s with efficient software packages.\n",
    "- Shift in the past decades (2000s - 2020s) data-driven optimisation, with the rise of machine learning and big data, lead to specific optimisation problems/formulations, changes the preferred classes of algorithms. Old algorithms became trendy again. Other algorithms are irrelevant (e.g. Newton's method).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Typical optimisation ML:\n",
    "Start with data $D = \\{(x_i, y_i)\\}_{i=1}^n$ and a model $h(x, \\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the parameter to be optimised. The goal is to discover a mapping between the input $x_i$ and the output $y_i$. $h$ such that $h(x_i, \\theta) \\approx y_i$ for all $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Process: Training/Learning\n",
    "Typically $h$ is defined/parameterized with a vector $\\theta \\in R^d$ and learning consists in finding the best $\\theta$ such that $h(x_i, w) \\approx y_i$ for all $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "An optimisation problem asscoiated with this task will have following form:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\min_{\\theta \\in R^d} f_D(\\theta) + \\lambda R(\\theta)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $f_D(\\theta)$ is the loss function, $R(\\theta)$ is the regularisation term and $\\lambda$ is the regularisation parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notation:\n",
    "$w = \\begin{bmatrix} w_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ w_d \\end{bmatrix} \\in R^d$ is the vector of parameters to be optimised.\n",
    "Objective function: $f(w) = f_D(w) + \\lambda R(w)$ is the function to be minimised.\n",
    "Optimal solution: $w^* = \\arg \\min_{w \\in R^d} f(w)$ is the vector of parameters that minimises the objective function.\n",
    "Optimal value: $f^* = f(w^*)$ is the value of the objective function at the optimal solution."
